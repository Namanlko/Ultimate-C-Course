// Instruction: A C program is a set of instructions. Just like a recepie - which contains instructions to prepare a particular Dish.

// Types of Instructions:
// 1) Type Declaration Instruction
// 2) Arithmetic Instruction
// 3) Control Instruction

int main(){
    
    // Lets Understand different types of Instructions with the help of an example.

    // Type Declaration Instruction:
    int i;
    float f;

    // Arithmetic Instruction:
    int a = 5;
    int b = 7;
    int sum = a + b;
    
    // Control Instruction:
    // Determines the flow of control in a program. Four types of Control Instruction in C are:
    // 1) Sequence Control Instruction.
    // 2) Decision Control Instruction.
    // 3) Loop Control Instruction.
    // 4) Case Control Instruction.

    // We will study all these instructions in this course later.
